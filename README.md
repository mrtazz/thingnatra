# Thingnatra - Sinatra webfrontend for Things.app

Access your [Things.app][1] todos from any computer.

## Motivation

I am a big fan of [Cultured Code][2]'s GTD app Things.app. I keep my data
in sync between my Macs with dropbox. However I want to
access my tasks also from my windows computer at work and possibly from
somewhere else.

## Dependencies

* sintra (obviously)
* mustache
* things-rb
* ...

## Installation & Usage
This is heavily WIP at the moment. Anything can/will change at anytime and
might or might not work. Your data could be messed up/lost/changed to something
else. So please only use it if you understand what that means.
